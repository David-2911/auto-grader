# Security Policy for Auto-Grader System

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented for the Auto-Grader system deployment.

## Network Security

### Firewall Configuration
- All unnecessary ports are blocked by default
- Only ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) are exposed to the internet
- Internal services communicate through private networks
- Database and Redis are only accessible from application subnets

### SSL/TLS Configuration
- TLS 1.2 and 1.3 only (TLS 1.0 and 1.1 disabled)
- Strong cipher suites configured
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) enabled
- Certificate pinning implemented where applicable

### Network Segmentation
- Application servers in private subnets
- Database servers in isolated subnets
- Load balancers in public subnets with restricted access
- No direct internet access to internal services

## Application Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with secure secrets (minimum 32 characters)
- Token expiration times configured appropriately
- Refresh token rotation implemented
- Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced
- Multi-factor authentication for admin accounts

### Input Validation
- All user inputs validated and sanitized
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection with Content Security Policy
- File upload restrictions and scanning
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

### Secrets Management
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Secrets rotation procedures in place
- No hardcoded credentials in code
- Encrypted storage for sensitive data

## Infrastructure Security

### Container Security
- Non-root user execution in containers
- Minimal base images (Alpine Linux)
- Regular security updates
- Image vulnerability scanning
- Read-only file systems where possible

### Database Security
- Encrypted connections (TLS)
- Database user with minimal privileges
- Regular security updates
- Encrypted storage at rest
- Database backup encryption

### Monitoring & Logging
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Security event monitoring
- Failed authentication attempt tracking
- Anomaly detection
- Log integrity protection

## Compliance & Data Protection

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest for all sensitive data
- Encryption in transit for all communications
- Personal data anonymization where possible
- Secure data disposal procedures
- Data backup encryption

### Educational Data Compliance
- FERPA compliance measures
- GDPR compliance for international users
- Data retention policies
- User consent management
- Right to data portability

## Security Procedures

### Incident Response
1. Immediate containment procedures
2. Impact assessment protocols
3. Communication plans
4. Recovery procedures
5. Post-incident analysis

### Vulnerability Management
1. Regular security assessments
2. Automated vulnerability scanning
3. Penetration testing schedule
4. Security patch management
5. Third-party security audits

### Access Control
1. Principle of least privilege
2. Regular access reviews
3. Privileged account management
4. Secure remote access procedures
5. Account lifecycle management
