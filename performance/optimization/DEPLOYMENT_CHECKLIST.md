```

## Performance Validation Tests

### Test 1: Database Performance
```bash
# Test database connection pooling
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/performance/test/database-load

# Expected: < 100ms average query time
# Expected: No connection pool exhaustion
```

### Test 2: Cache Performance
```bash
# Test cache hit rates
curl http://localhost:5000/api/performance/cache/stats

# Expected: > 85% hit rate after warm-up
# Expected: < 50ms cache access time
```

### Test 3: File Processing Performance
```bash
# Test OCR processing with worker threads
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/assignments/upload \
  -F "file=@test-document.pdf"

# Expected: < 30 seconds for 50MB files
# Expected: No main thread blocking
```

### Test 4: Frontend Performance
```bash
# Test bundle size optimization
npm run build:analyze

# Expected: Main bundle < 500KB
# Expected: Total bundle < 2MB
# Expected: Lighthouse score > 90
```

### Test 5: API Response Times
```bash
# Test API performance under load
artillery quick --count 100 --num 10 http://localhost:5000/api/assignments

# Expected: 95th percentile < 2 seconds
# Expected: Error rate < 1%
```

## Monitoring and Alerting Setup

### Grafana Dashboard Configuration

1. **Access Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)

2. **Import Performance Dashboard**:
   - Go to Dashboards → Import
   - Upload `deployment/monitoring/grafana/performance-dashboard.json`
   - Configure data source as Prometheus (http://prometheus:9090)

3. **Key Metrics to Monitor**:
   - API response times (95th percentile)
   - Database query performance
   - Cache hit rates
   - System resource utilization
   - Error rates

### Alert Configuration

```yaml
# Key alerts configured in deployment/monitoring/rules/performance-alerts.yml
- High API response time (> 2 seconds)
- High error rate (> 5%)
- Low cache hit rate (< 80%)
- High CPU usage (> 75%)
- High memory usage (> 80%)
```

## Performance Baseline Metrics
